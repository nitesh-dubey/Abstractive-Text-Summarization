# Abstractive-Text-Summarization
...
In this notebook I've implemented ***Abstractive Text Summarizer*** using Tensorflow and keras.
The ***Amazon Fine Food Review dataset*** from kaggle was used for training the model.
The raw data is present in Reviews.csv and cleaned data is present in cleaned_reviews.csv.

The h5 files contains final trained models for the summarizer.
